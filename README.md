# Cache-Sim
The code below creates a cache simulator. 


Cache_sim.cpp - just a basic cache 
The simulator will be invoked with three command-line arguments as follows: 
./cache_sim mem_size cache_size access_filename

 • mem_size - Size of the memory in blocks, which must be divisible by 2. 
 • cache_size - Size of the cache in blocks, must be a factor of mem_size.
 • access_filename - A limitless file with a list of block addresses separated 
 by a space. No address should exceed the mem_size

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cache_simulator.cpp - A 2-level cache, that determines hits and miss percentages 

Example input in command prompt: 

./cache_simulator mem_size L1_cache_size L2_cache_size L1_associativity access_filename

Example 2
cache_simulator.exe 8192 512 8192 4 accesslist.txt

> 8192: Memory size in bytes.
> 512: L1 cache size in bytes.
> 8192: L2 cache size in bytes.
> 4: L1 cache associativity.
> input_access.txt: File containing memory access addresses.
>


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A file with the name of "hitmiss-out.txt" which has a line with the address and whether there was 
a hit or a miss. The program should also report on the hit/miss percentages. 
Example: 
Reference file "accesslist.txt" contains the line "1 3 4 1 3 1". 
Call the command: ./cache_sim 4 2 accesslist.txt.
 Resulting file "hitmiss-out.txt" should contain:
